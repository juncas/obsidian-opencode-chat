## How Community Plugins Are Pulled

According to the official documentation:

1. Obsidian reads the list of plugins from `community-plugins.json`
2. The `name`, `author` and `description` fields are used for searching
3. When users open the plugin detail page, Obsidian pulls `manifest.json` and `README.md` from your GitHub repo
4. The `manifest.json` in your repo is used to determine the latest version
5. Actual plugin files are fetched from your GitHub releases (tagged identically to the version in `manifest.json`)
6. Obsidian downloads `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css` (if available) from the release
